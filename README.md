## Project Overview

This project is created as a C-only port of [another project of mine](https://github.com/adachng/ECS-Snake-Game) with the following differences:

- No need for ECS design pattern, as the main point of this project is to explore C.
- Unit testing is still done, but the library has to be different since [`googletest`](https://github.com/adachng/ECS-Snake-Game) is implemented in C++, and the reason for this C port may be platform compatibility.
